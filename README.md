# SeaInvaders

Super basic stylised Space Invaders game written for my Introduction to Coding module (5 weeks).
As a result will likely be horribly inefficient in some places! 

Requires Processing latest version to run and Waterlily from the data folder to be installed on the computer to view the text properly.
